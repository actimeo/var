COMMENT ON SCHEMA login IS 'This module is used for the user to authenticate. 
Each user has a login and a password.

Adding a user
-------------
A first user is created during installation, with the login ''variation'' and a password provided during installation.

Users with "users" privileges can add users.

A password is composed of at least 8 characters, from 3 different types from (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special char).

A password must be changed at least every 6(param) months.

User Authentication
-------------------
A user can authenticate with the function user_login(login, pwd). This function returns a token which is used to access other functions of the api.

If authentication fails 5 times in a row for the same user, the account is blocked during a certain period of time and/or can be unblocked from an administrator (depending on parametrization).

The token becomes invalid:
- after a certain period of inactivity (ie no function was called with this token)
- when user disconnects with function user_logout(token)

Staff member
------------
A user can be linked to a staff member. If so, the user will have access to patients assigned to groups at which the staff member is also assigned.
If a user is not linked to a staff member, he will be considered an admin and hace access to all patients.

Portals
-------
A user can have access to patients data through one or several portals.
